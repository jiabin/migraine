# Migraine

Yet another tool for migrations.

# Install

    composer install

# Launch

    ./bin/migraine

# Build

You will need:
* [box](http://box-project.org) 
* [jsawk](https://github.com/micha/jsawk) 

Once you have installed all required dependencies run `box build` to build
a PHAR file. Then you can launch the app: `./migraine.phar`.
